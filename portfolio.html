            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Born in Waco, Tx, 1995. Moved to the Austin, Tx area when I was about 12. I've always had a love
            for video games and electronics. I'm a family man, I can't get enough time to hangout with my wife 
            son. We have a circus of animals, 3 dogs, a cat and one child! It is a wild house all the time. I'm 
            working full time aswell as working on this bootcamp. It is rough but going to be so worth all the late 
            nights and screen-filled days.
